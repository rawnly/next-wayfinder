# Hostname Checks

In some cases, you might want to check paths on a domain (i.e., using the same project for handling both the public website and the dashboard).
This can be easily achieved by passing an array of middleware as a handler. 

<Callout>
The `handlePaths` function iterates recursively over all the items provided (including nested ones), so a very high level of complexity can be "handled". 
However, to improve performance, I would recommend keeping it as simple as possible.

```ts filename="middleware.ts" copy showLineNumbers
export default handlePaths([
    {
        hostname: /^app\./,
        handler: [
            {
                path: "/",
                handler: req =>
                    NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/dashboard", req.url)),
            },
            /*  This is the default behaviour */
            {
                path: "/:path*",
                handler: (req, res) => res,
            },
        ],
    },
]);
```
